# Study 2

## Simulation Strategy

We conducted two power analyses for Study 2 using the TOSTER package. First, we estimated the sample size required to detect a positive correlation of $\rho$ = 0.25 using a one-sided test at $\alpha$ = 0.05 with 80% power. The required sample size was approximately $n$ = 97.

Second, we estimated the sample size needed to conclude statistical equivalence, using a TOST procedure with equivalence bounds of Â±0.25 (i.e., testing whether the true effect is smaller than this threshold). With Î± = 0.05 and desired power = 0.90, the required sample size was approximately n = 169.


## CDI

SegÃºn Fenson et al. (2007) y datos de validaciÃ³n (p. ej., valididad concurrente), las puntuaciones de vocabulario expresivo y gramatical al rededor de los 36 meses tienden a distribuirse asÃ­:

Vocabulario expresivo (0â€‘100):

Media aproximada: ~50 â€“ 60

DesviaciÃ³n tÃ­pica: ~20 â€“ 25 (siguiendo una distribuciÃ³n ligeramente sesgada a la derecha)

## CHIMUS

With both in hand, we can now simulate realistic raw CHIMUS scores for 3-year-olds, based on:

The 9-item final CHIMUS scale [from Table 2 in the paper and Supplement S2]

Age-specific descriptives from the 3â€“6-year-old subgroup

ðŸ§’ CHIMUS Items
Each item is scored on a 1â€“5 Likert scale, where:

Most items use either agreement ("totally disagree" to "totally agree") or frequency ("never" to "always").

Some items are reverse-coded (e.g., difficulty paying attention, reproducing melodies).

CHIMUS includes 3 subscales:

Enthusiasm & Motivation:

"often has the desire to make music"

"has great enthusiasm for music"

"enjoys making music as part of their life"

Music Perception:

"has a good sense of timing and rhythm"

"has a feeling for the beat"

"has good hearing ability, e.g., for melodies and rhythms"

Music Production (reverse-coded):

"shows difficulties in producing/reproducing music"

"pays little attention while making music"

"has issues reproducing melodies"

ðŸ“Š Approximate Descriptives for Children Aged 3
From the paper:

Mean age for the 3â€“6 group: ~4.8 years (SD â‰ˆ 1.0)

No exact breakdown by age 3, but younger children scored lower on Music Production and Perception, not necessarily on Motivation

Subscale Î± (reliability):

Motivation: ~.81

Perception: ~.84

Production: ~.78

âœ… Recommended Simulation Values (per subscale)
Each subscale ranges from 3 to 15 (3 items Ã— 1â€“5). For 3-year-olds:

Subscale	Mean	SD	Notes
Enthusiasm & Motivation	12.0	2.0	Likely high even in younger children
Music Perception	9.5	2.2	Developing, more variable
Music Production	9.0	2.4	Likely lower; reverse-coded items
Total Score (sum)	30.5	5.2	Out of 45

```{r}
n <- 1000  # Number of children

# Simulate subscale scores (bounded between 3 and 15)
motivation <- round(pmin(pmax(rnorm(n, mean = 12, sd = 2), 3), 15))
perception <- round(pmin(pmax(rnorm(n, mean = 9.5, sd = 2.2), 3), 15))
production <- round(pmin(pmax(rnorm(n, mean = 9, sd = 2.4), 3), 15))

# Total score
total <- motivation + perception + production

# Combine into data frame
chimus_data <- data.frame(
  age = 3,
  motivation,
  perception,
  production,
  total
)

## IDS acoustics

âœ… Suggested Values for Simulating IDS (Mothers)
ðŸŽµ Mean pitch (fâ‚€ mean) in IDS
Mean: ~280 Hz

SD: ~30â€“40 Hz

Range (minâ€“max across speakers): 210â€“350 Hz

These values are based on:

Fernald & Kuhl (1987) found mean fâ‚€ in English-speaking mothersâ€™ IDS around 280 Hz.

Kitamura et al. (2001): Australian English-speaking mothers had average IDS pitch of ~270â€“290 Hz.

Hartman et al. (2022): IDS mean pitch ranged from 230 to 350 Hz depending on culture.

ðŸ”€ Pitch variability (fâ‚€ SD) in IDS
Mean (SD of fâ‚€ within utterances): ~50 Hz

SD: ~15 Hz

Range: 30â€“80 Hz

Examples:

Trainor et al. (2000) and Fernald (1991) report typical fâ‚€ SDs in IDS between 40â€“60 Hz, often higher than in ADS.

Broesch & Bryant (2018) report ~43 Hz (SD ~21) in IDS.

### Correlation between mean fâ‚€ and fâ‚€ variability in Infant-Directed Speech (IDS)

1. Kitamura et al. (2001) â€“ Australian mothers
Studied emotional tone in IDS.

Reported a moderate positive correlation between mean fâ‚€ and fâ‚€ range/variability (e.g., happier speech = higher pitch and more pitch modulation).

While exact coefficients werenâ€™t reported, visual data suggest r â‰ˆ .3â€“.5 in some conditions.

2. Fernald et al. (1989) â€“ Cross-linguistic sample
Found that languages with higher mean fâ‚€ in IDS also had greater pitch range and modulation.

Group-level correlations (across languages) appeared strong, but individual-level correlations were moderate at best, with substantial variability.

3. Broesch & Bryant (2018) â€“ Fathers in small-scale societies
Reported higher mean fâ‚€ accompanied by greater pitch range and variability, especially in rural IDS.

Though no direct correlation coefficient was provided, descriptives show that increases in fâ‚€ mean and SD often co-occur.

4. Xu et al. (2013) â€“ Prosodic functions
In adult emotional speech, which shares some features with IDS, fâ‚€ mean and SD are positively but not perfectly correlated (r ~ .3â€“.6 depending on emotion).

This suggests a biologically grounded but flexible relationship, likely similar in IDS.

ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion: Correlation Between fâ‚€ Mean and SD in IDS
Direction: Positive

Magnitude: Small to moderate (typically r = 0.2â€“0.5)

Interpretation: Mothers who speak with higher pitch in IDS often (but not always) also show greater pitch variability.
